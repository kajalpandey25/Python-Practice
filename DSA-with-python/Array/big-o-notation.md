Big O notation=>
Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grow as input size grows.

Rules=>
1. Keep fastest growing term
2. Drop constants

BigO refers to very large value of n. Hence if you have a function like,

time = 5*n*n + 3*n + 20

when value of n is very large b*n + c become irrevelant.


Measuring running time growth:

          time complexity

Measuring space growth:

           Space complexity



=>In python, list is implemented as dynamic array.

=> In other languages like JAVA, C++ we have static and dynamic arrays both.


=> Arrays can store numbers, text or complex objects.

stock_prices = [2,3,5,6]

stock_names = ["Apple", "IBM", "TATA"]

stock_data = [
    {"ticker": "AAPL","Price": 302},
    {"ticker": "TSLA","Price": 902},
    {"ticker": "TATA","Price": 432},
]
