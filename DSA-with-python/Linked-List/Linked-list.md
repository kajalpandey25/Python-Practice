Linked list is a data structure similar to array in a sense that it stores bunch of items. But unlike array, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. They are instead chained by an element storing address location of next element. This makes insertion very easy. Also unlike dynamic arrays you don't have to pre-allocate some memory capacity.

Linked-List has two main benefits over an array.

1. You don't need to pre-allocate space.
2. Insertion is easier.

-> Linked list Traversal = o(n)
-> Accessing Element By value = o(n)
