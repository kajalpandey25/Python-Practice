Project: To-Do List Application

Description:
Create a simple to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, view their tasks, and remove tasks.

Key Concepts:

Data storage and manipulation (using lists or dictionaries).
User input and interaction.
Conditionals (if statements) for decision making.
Loops (for or while loops) for iteration.
Functions for organizing code into reusable blocks.
Example Features:

Add a task to the to-do list.
Mark a task as completed.
View the list of tasks.
Remove a task from the list.
Save tasks to a file for persistence (optional).
Possible Extensions:

Implement a due date for tasks.
Add categories or tags for tasks.
Implement a priority system for tasks.
Create a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) for the application.
Allow users to edit existing tasks.
